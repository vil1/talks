# Enter the Loop

Attending conferences and meetups has become a standard practice for developers all over the world. And so here you are, reading these words in order to decide which session to attend next.

But you might not be aware of the sheer amount of work it takes to build a conference or meetup program, mostly because of the scarcity of its most needed resource: speakers.

My goal is to make you realise that the community desperately needs more volunteers to share insights and disseminate ideas, and that *you* have all it takes to help.

I will cover all the steps it takes to give a talk, from coming up with a cool abstract to handling the Q&A session. You will see that each of them is within your grasp, that all that separates you from being a speaker is just a little work and a (tiny) leap of faith.
