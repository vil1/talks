# My talks

Welcome! In this repository, you will find a comprehensive list of the conference talks I've given in the past, with slides and videos. For each talk, there will be a Markdown file containing the abstract of the talk and one or many links to videos of the talk, as well as a PDF version of the slides (when applicable). I've decided to sort these in two main directories: `soft` for the "soft-skills" talks and `hard` for the more technical ones.

You can also [create an issue](https://github.com/vil1/talks/issues/new?assignees=vil1&labels=&template=talk-request.md&title=Please+do+a+talk+about+%3Cinsert+topic+here%3E) if you think I should give a talk about a specific subject in the future.

I didn't come up with the idea of such repo, but [Jakub](https://github.com/kubukoz) did, and you should definitely go check his [videos](https://github.com/kubukoz/videos) out!
